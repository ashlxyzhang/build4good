<h1>Curious Collections</h1>

Hi TACS! Our project is for the supporting small businesses and Notion API categories. We wanted to combine our love of music with technology. 
It features a Notion database/querying, recommendation algorithm for albums, and a song tune recognizer! <br/> <br />
We wanted to help Curious Collections have an automated and concise system for keeping track of their album inventory. Using Notion as a database was something that we were new to, but it worked out well in the end. We used the Notion integration secret and database id to retrieve, filter, and sort the data using Express. We hope that this idea will help Curious Collections in keeping track of their inventory and generate more traffic to their site.

<h3>Technologies Used</h3>
We mainly used TypeScript (React) and Tailwind CSS for the frontend, and JavaScript and Python for the backend. For frameworks, libraries, and APIs, we used Express, Flask, scikit-learn, AUDD, Spotify, Node.js, npm, axios, and more. It was a lot of work, but also a lot of fun!
